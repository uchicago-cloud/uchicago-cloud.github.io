## Course Content ##
This course will explore the current state of backend solutions for mobile applications.  Students will work with third-party solutions such as a Firebase and Realm Mobile Platform.  Students will also design and implement a custom solutions hosed on Google Compute Engine with significant emphasis on API design and performance.  


## Coursework ##
This course will be assignment and project based and have no exams.  This course will assume you are proficient in developing a native mobile application.  Students should be willing to supplement their knowledge of iOS and/or Android to support the development of their backend solution.  Classtime dedicated to developing the mobile applications will be extremely limited.  While the course is designed to be cross-platform, emphasis will be given to specific platform features that interact directly with backends (eg. push notifications).
