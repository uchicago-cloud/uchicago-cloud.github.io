Assignment
============

This week you should become familiar with Firebase by completing the following tutorials. One uses the realtime database and one uses firestore.
* https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firestore-ios/index.html
* https://www.raywenderlich.com/3-firebase-tutorial-getting-started

This tutorial has not been updated for Swift 5 so it will require some updating. You will be building a chat application next week, so this will be fery helpful for thinking about how to set it up.
* https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-ios-swift/


In addition, you should review all of the resources above (as much as you need to).  I would recommend watching the latest videos from Google I/O or Firebase Summit on YouTube.
