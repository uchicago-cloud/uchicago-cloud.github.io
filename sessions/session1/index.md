Assignment
-----------
Assignment 1 is due Wednesday, April 5th, 2017 at 5:29pm.
* [Post a message](https://github.com/uchicago-cloud/mpcs51033-2017-spring-forum/issues) to the course forum in the "Welcome to Backends for Mobile Applications!" thread.
* Review the documentation for [Python on Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/) for the [Standard Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/).  There is quite a bit of fragmented information about App Engine in the documentation so there isn't a linear path to reading it.  You should just try to become familiar with some of the capabilities and terminology, we will review it in the first class.
* Complete the following tutorials (in this order):
  - [Hello World tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tutorials)
  - [Guestbook tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tutorials)
